This map applies a bivariate color scheme to display the number of breweries and average beer ABV across states. The color palette was implemented with the [pals R package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pals/vignettes/pals_examples.html). Since making this graphic, I've also used [this elegant guide](https://timogrossenbacher.ch/2019/04/bivariate-maps-with-ggplot2-and-sf/) by Timo Grossenbacker to make maps with more customized bivariate color palettes.
