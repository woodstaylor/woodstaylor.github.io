I visualized county percentages of state populations using data from the R package [tidycensus](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/articles/basic-usage.html). Mapping the percentages nation-wide revealed states with large vs. small urban-rural divides. This infographic made use of [small multiples](https://www.juiceanalytics.com/writing/better-know-visualization-small-multiples) to map state-wide population patterns using the package [tmap](https://tlorusso.github.io/geodata_workshop/tmap_package).
