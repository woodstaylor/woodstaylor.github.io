This infographic visualizes aspects of MLB and minor league (MiLB) baseball using data scraped from [this user-created google map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?ll=36.932760327261256%2C-116.97300641874999&z=4&mid=1DII60zjvrZ5LoSsbp-mrQd1wCWW6UqWo). 
The upper left plot is a bar plot edited in Illustrator showing the number of teams in each league. 
The middle row shows team characteristics: a cartogram created in the R package [statebins](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/statebins/statebins.pdf) to show the number of teams in each state and a [wordcloud](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/wordcloud.html) to show the most prevalent words in team names across leagues. 
The maps at the bottom are a series of small multiples indicating the network of MLB and MiLB teams throughout the US. The size of the circles indicates leagues (largest size == MLB) and the colors are [MLB team colors](https://teamcolorcodes.com/mlb-color-codes/). [Download here](https://github.com/woodstaylor/woodstaylor.github.io/raw/master/assets/infographics/MLBaffiliates.pdf).

I also made an interactive R Shiny app [here](https://woodstaylor.shinyapps.io/MLBaffiliates/) that uses the same dataset.
