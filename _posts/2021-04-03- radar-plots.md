I used a [kaggle dataset on Seinfeld](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles) to visualize characters, episodes, and writers throughout the 9 seasons of the show. This infographic uses [radar charts](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/spider-or-radar-chart.html) to show the number of lines per character in Seinfeld over the seasons. I also used [nested donut charts](https://woodstaylor.github.io/blog/donut-plots/) to show the proportion of total lines spoken per character each season.
