### freshwater macroecology

My research broadly addresses the following questions in freshwaters:

+ how is biodiversity distributed across space and through time?
+ what factors constrain body size/biomass from organisms to communities?
+ how do phenology regimes respond to changing environmental contexts?

I adress these questions across spatial scales, from local (catchment-scale) to regional (continental/global).

#### biodiversity

In addition to taxonomic diversity, understanding how functional diversity is impacted by global change 

#### body size/biomass


#### phenology

The timing of reproductive and life cycle events (phenology) is well investigated in terrestrial environments, whereas freshwater phenology is understudied. However, freshwater phenology is likely to experience unique stressors
