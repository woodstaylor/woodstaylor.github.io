### ![fishcode](/assets/images/fishcode.jpg) stream macroecology

Streams and rivers are the most biodiverse ecological systems per unit area, and a disproportionate amount of biodiversity in these habitats is threatened by global change. 

I use publicly available data collected by professional researchers, community scientists, and government agencies to assess 3 common ecological responses to global change in streams at large spatiotemporal scales:
+ Shifts in species ranges toward higher elevations and latitudes
+ Shifts in body size toward smaller-bodied individuals
+ Shifts in seasonal life history/life cycle events toward earlier timing

Ecological communities will reorganize as species distributions shift in response to global change. My research analyzes what factors determine the magnitude of biodiversity in a system, how biodiversity will redistribute in the future, and effects of this reorganization on freshwater ecosystem functioning.

#### ![fishcode](/assets/images/fishcode.jpg) body size

Stream fish body sizes vary from species that reach adult size at < 1.0 gram to megafauna weighing over 1000 kg. My research examines spatiotemporal patterns in body size and allometric relationships that describe how rates and traits scale with body size across biological scales.

#### ![fishcode](/assets/images/fishcode.jpg) phenology

Terrestrial environments indicate earlier timing of reproductive and life cycle events (phenology) due to global change. I study how stream temperature and flow determine the timing of macroinvertebrate emergence and fish spawning events and understand how traits can inform species senstitivities to these environmental cues.
