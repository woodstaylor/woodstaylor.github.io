### freshwater macroecology

My research broadly addresses the following questions in freshwaters:

+ how is freshwater biodiversity distributed across space and through time?
+ what factors constrain body size from organisms to communities?
+ how do phenology regimes respond to changing environmental contexts?

I adress these questions across spatial scales, from local (catchment-scale) to regional (continental/global).
