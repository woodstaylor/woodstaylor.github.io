### ![fishcode](/assets/images/fishcode.jpg) stream macroecology

Streams and rivers are the most biodiverse ecological systems per unit area.

*fishes sampled in the Tennessee River, clockwise from top left: greenside darter, snail darter, redline darter, silver chub*

I use publicly available data collected by professional researchers, community scientists, and government agencies to assess 3 predicted ecological responses to global change (and exceptions to these predictions):

#### ![fishcode](/assets/images/fishcode.jpg) biodiversity
+ Shifts in species ranges toward higher elevations and (absolute) latitudes

#### ![fishcode](/assets/images/fishcode.jpg) body size
+ Shifts in body size toward smaller-bodied individuals

#### ![fishcode](/assets/images/fishcode.jpg) phenology
+ Shifts in seasonal life history/life cycle events toward earlier timing
