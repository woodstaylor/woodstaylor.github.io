Hi - I'm Taylor! I'm a graduate student in [Xingli Giam's lab](https://giamlab.com) at the [University of Tennessee, Knoxville Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://eeb.utk.edu).

I'm a freshwater macroecologist. My research examines processes underlying patterns in biodiversity, body size, and phenology and how ongoing gloabl change affects these patterns.

When not researching, I enjoy visualizing datasets on almost any topic, running, watching basketball and baseball (go Cards!), baking pastries, churning ice creams, and whipping meringues.

I love dogs. Especially rescue mutts, and especially pitties and pitt mixes - of which I am a  doggy parent to two:
