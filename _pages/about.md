Hi - I'm Taylor! I'm a graduate student in [Xingli Giam's lab](https://giamlab.com) at the [University of Tennessee, Knoxville Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology](https://eeb.utk.edu).

You can read more about my research on the [research page](https://woodstaylor.github.io/research).

When not researching, I enjoy exploring publicly available datasets on almost any topic, running, baking pastries, and watching basketball and baseball.

I love dogs. Especially rescue mutts, and especially pitties and pit mixes - of which I am a proud dog mom to two:
