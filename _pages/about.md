Hi - I'm Taylor! I'm a postdoctoral researcher with the [US Geological Survey](https://usgs.gov) at the [Eastern Ecological Science Center](https://usgs.gov/centers.eesc).

I'm a freshwater macroecologist. My research examines processes underlying patterns in biodiversity, body size, and phenology and how ongoing global change affects these patterns.

When not researching, I enjoy visualizing datasets on almost any topic, running, watching basketball and baseball (go Cards!), baking pastries, churning ice creams, and whipping meringues.

I love dogs. Especially rescue mutts, and especially pitties and pitt mixes - of which I am a  doggy parent to two:
