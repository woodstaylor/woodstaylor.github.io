I like to analyze and visualize free datasets on almost any topic, but my favorites are science, sports, food, and politics.

Here are examples of infographics I've made:
+ [science](https://woodstaylor.github.io/infographicsScience/)
+ [sports](https://woodstaylor.github.io/infographicsSports/)
+ [food (& beverage)](https://woodstaylor.github.io/infographicsFood/)
+ [politics](https://woodstaylor.github.io/infographicsPolitics/)
+ [everything else](https://woodstaylor.github.io/infographicsMisc/)

For interactive graphics, I use R Shiny applications - here are a few I've designed:
+ [MLB affiliates](https://woodstaylor.shinyapps.io/MLBaffiliates/): a map showing the locations of MLB teams and their minor league affiliate teams
+ [MLB manager networks](https://woodstaylor.shinyapps.io/MLBmanagerNetworks/): networks showing relationships (number of years associated together) between MLB players and managers
+ [US aquatic community science](https://woodstaylor.shinyapps.io/fwCommSci/): a dataset showcasing the present state of US community science programs targeting aquatic habitats
+ [size spectra](https://sizespectra.shinyapps.io/sizespectra_app/): a tool to teach aquatic size spectra techniques and allow researchers to input their own datasets
