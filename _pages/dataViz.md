I like to analyze and visualize free datasets on almost any topic, but my favorites are science, sports, food, and politics.

My preferred programming languages are R and Python and I use the Adobe suite (Illustrator and InDesign) for infographics.

Here are examples of infographics I've made, sorted into categories (you can also view and download these files in individual posts on the home page):
+ [science](https://woodstaylor.github.io/infographicsScience/)
+ [sports](https://woodstaylor.github.io/infographicsSports/)
+ [food (& beverage)](https://woodstaylor.github.io/infographicsFood/)
+ [politics](https://woodstaylor.github.io/infographicsPolitics/)
+ [everything else](https://woodstaylor.github.io/infographicsMisc/)

For interactive graphics, I've used HTML and javascript (including D3). More recently, I use R Shiny applications - here are a few I've designed:

+ [MLB affiliates](https://woodstaylor.shinyapps.io/MLBaffiliates/): a map showing the locations of MLB teams and their minor league affiliate teams
+ [US aquatic community science](https://woodstaylor.shinyapps.io/fwCommSci/): a dataset showcasing the present state of US community science programs targeting aquatic habitats
+ [size spectra](https://sizespectra.shinyapps.io/sizespectra_app/): a tool to teach aquatic size spectra techniques and allow researchers to input their own datasets
